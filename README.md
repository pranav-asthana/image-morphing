# Image morphing

The project has two parts in two jupyter notebooks. The code for the delaunay triangulation method is in `Final Project-Delaunay_catlion.ipynb` and the code for the automated method using structural similarity is in `Final project-Automated.ipynb`.

All the data is stored in the directories `images/` and `samples/`. How to run the code is self-explanatory from the notebooks.
